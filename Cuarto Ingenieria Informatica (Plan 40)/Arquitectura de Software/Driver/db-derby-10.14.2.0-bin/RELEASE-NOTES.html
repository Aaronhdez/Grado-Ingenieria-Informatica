<p>
The most up to date information about Derby releases can be found on the
<a href="http://db.apache.org/derby/derby_downloads.html">Derby download page</a>.
</p>


<p>
Apache Derby is a pure Java relational database engine using standard SQL and
JDBC as its APIs. More information about Derby can be found on the
<a href="http://db.apache.org/derby/">Apache web site</a>.
Derby functionality includes:
</p>


<ul>

<li>Embedded engine with JDBC drivers</li>

<li>Network Server</li>

<li>Network client JDBC drivers</li>

<li>Command line tools: ij (SQL scripting), dblook (schema dump) and sysinfo (system info)</li>

</ul>


<p>
Support for Java SE 8 is being sunsetted and will not be supported by the next (10.15) release family. The 10.14 release family supports the following Java and JDBC versions:
</p>

<ul>
  
<li>Java SE 8 and higher with JDBC 4.2.</li>
  
<li>Java SE 8 compact profile 2.</li>

</ul>

<p>Compared with the previous release (10.14.1.0), Derby release 10.14.2.0 introduces the following new features and incompatibilities. These merit your special attention.</p>

<div>


<h4>Summary of Change</h4>

<p>
The default Network Server security policy has been simplified.
</p>



<h4>Symptoms Seen by Applications Affected by Change</h4>

<p>
If you start the Network Server without specifying a security
manager, the Network Server will install a default Java
security manager that enforces a basic policy. This security
policy is now simpler than it was in previous releases.
</p>



<h4>Incompatibilities with Previous Release</h4>

<p>
If your Network Server deployment has particular security
requirements, the default security policy is not right for
you. You should instead deploy the Network Server with a
customized security policy file, as described in the
Security guide.
</p>



<h4>Rationale for Change</h4>

<p>
A simpler default security policy file is preferable, as it
is easier to understand.
</p>



<h4>Application Changes Required</h4>

<p>
Please review the "Configuring Java security" topic in
the Security guide for a detailed description of how to
configure the Network Server security policy.
</p>

<div>


<h4>Summary of Change</h4>

<p>
COMMAND_TESTCONNECTION no longer has database open support.
</p>



<h4>Symptoms Seen by Applications Affected by Change</h4>

<p>
The Network Server's COMMAND_TESTCONNECTION operation, which is
used by the Network Server 'ping' feature, contained code which
could attempt to open a database specified as part of the 'ping'
request. This code has been removed.
</p>


<h4>Rationale for Change</h4>

<p>
It is not necessary to attempt to open a database in order
to ping the Network Server.

<a name="Verifying Releases"></a>Verifying Releases</h2>

<p>It is essential that you verify the integrity of the downloaded
files using the PGP and MD5 signatures.  MD5 verification ensures the
file was not corrupted during the download process.  PGP verification
ensures that the file came from a certain person.</p>


<p>The PGP signatures can be verified using
<a href="http://www.pgpi.org/">PGP</a> or
<a href="http://www.gnupg.org/">GPG</a>.
First download the Apache Derby
<a href="https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/db/derby/KEYS">KEYS</a>
as well as the <code>asc</code> signature file for the particular
distribution. It is important that you get these files from the ultimate
trusted source - the main ASF distribution site, rather than from a mirror.
Then verify the signatures using ...</p>


<pre>
% pgpk -a KEYS
% pgpv db-derby-X.Y.tar.gz.asc

<em>or</em>

% pgp -ka KEYS
% pgp db-derby-X.Y.tar.gz.asc

<em>or</em>

% gpg --import KEYS
% gpg --verify db-derby-X.Y.tar.gz.asc

</pre>


<p>To verify the MD5 signature on the files, you need to use a program
called <code>md5</code> or <code>md5sum</code>, which is
included in many unix distributions.  It is also available as part of
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/textutils/textutils.html">GNU
Textutils</a>.  Windows users can get binary md5 programs from <a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/md5/">here</a>, <a href="http://www.pc-tools.net/win32/freeware/console/">here</a>, or
<a href="http://www.slavasoft.com/fsum/">here</a>.</p>


<p>We strongly recommend that you verify your downloads with both PGP and MD5.</p>
